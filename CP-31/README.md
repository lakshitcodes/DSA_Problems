# CP-31

This folder contains my solutions to the **CP-31 Sheet** curated by [TLE Eliminators](https://www.tle-eliminators.com/cp-sheet), a well-structured resource aimed at improving your competitive programming skills progressively, especially for platforms like **Codeforces**.

## 📚 About the Sheet

The **CP-21 Sheet** is a comprehensive practice roadmap divided by Codeforces problem ratings (e.g., 800, 900, 1000, …), helping you master problems level by level.

## 🧭 Folder Structure

Each subfolder corresponds to a **Codeforces problem rating**, and contains my C++ solutions for problems of that rating.

```
CP-31/
├── 800/
│   ├── Problem1.cpp
│   └── Problem2.cpp
├── 900/
│   ├── Problem1.cpp
│   └── Problem2.cpp
└── ...
```

All filenames follow **PascalCase** formatting for consistency and easy navigation.

## ⚙️ Note on `.cph` Folder

You'll notice a `.cph` folder in this directory. It exists because I use the **Competitive Programming Helper** extension in **VS Code** for fast compiling, running, and testing. You can install it too for a better workflow:
