# DSA Problems

A curated collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problem solutions from various competitive programming platforms, organized for easy navigation and quick access.

## 📂 Overview

This repository contains my solutions to problems from the following platforms:

- **CSES** – Solutions from the [CSES Problemset](https://cses.fi/problemset/), organized by question name and number.
- **Codechef** – Solutions organized by contest date, problem number, and division type.
- **Codeforces** – Solutions sorted by contest date, problem number, and division type.
- **CodeStudio (Now Coding Ninjas)** – Solutions categorized by question name.
- **GeeksforGeeks** – Solutions written in PascalCase, organized by question name.
- **InterviewBit** – Solutions organized by question name.
- **LeetCode** – Solutions arranged by question name and number for easy lookup.
- **Data Structures** – Modular, reusable implementations of commonly used data structures.
- **`boiler.cpp`** – My competitive programming boilerplate with optimized macros, templates, and utility functions.
- All filenames follow **PascalCase** formatting.

## 🧭 Navigation Guide

### 🔹 LeetCode

- Navigate using either the **question name** or **question number**.
- File names include the problem number for fast searching.

### 🔹 CSES

- Search solutions by **problem name** or **problem number** (matches CSES Problemset index).

### 🔹 Codeforces & Codechef

- Organized by:
  - **Contest date**
  - **Problem number** (e.g., A, B, C…)
  - **Division type** (Div2, Div3, etc.)

### 🔹 GeeksforGeeks

- Find solutions using the **problem name**.
